## What
Evergreen are `Conceptual notes` consist of `atomic-sized, independent ideas` that are then `connected with related ideas`.

As the name evergreen suggests, they are continually revisited and refined as we come across more information in the resources we consume.

They can come in `various forms` to act as building blocks for the overall structure of our thought navigation.

They are a type of idea-based note, which you can learn more about in `Note types`
## How
Notes with a specific status can be seen in [[My Greenhouse]]
### Creation
I usually just use the quick switcher and type the name of the note, then press Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to create it.

Then I set `Links` to a higher-order note, and start `Note-making`

For other notes, in `USV Glossary`, you will need to use [[QuickAdd Plugin]] to create them.

### Metadata

#### Status

##### SeedlingsÂ 
ðŸŒ±
- For ideas that you just want to record, then grow later
- I just create the note title, and then set the status to ðŸŒ±
- This is what I would consider to be `Fleeting Notes`
- Once you start growing the idea, it `Sprouts`
##### SproutsÂ 
ðŸŒ¿
- Sprouting ideas that you are still in the process of growing and nurturing
    - Can range from a few jot notes to an overall structure, but the thing is, you still feel like they are not ready to be part of the rest of the `Trees`. They need a bit more nurturing, whether it be by `Making connections between notes` or doing more `Research`
    - With sprouts, there is no rigid method for developing them as it is based on what you intuitively want to grow the note into, but if you want a more structured place to think, you can consider `Brainstorms`
##### TreesÂ 
ðŸŒ²
- Trees are notes mature enough to be part of your forest:
    - Already has connections with related notes
    - Contents of the note satisfy the title
- These are evergreen, meaning they continue to grow as you find more insights from `Content consumption` or form more connections
- I personally don't follow this though. Instead, I'm playing around with using it to mostly highlight the unique evergreen ideas in my vault

Understand the different statuses when `Managing and growing evergreen notes` in the vault.
