## Sections 

To use the vault to its full potential, I recommend setting it up in the order I shared below:

### Life Design 

Populate your [Vision Board](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Vision+Board) by doing the following:

- [ ] Write out your core values in [My Values](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/values)
- [ ] Create [Areas](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Areas) notes for the existing core responsibilities in your life
- [ ] Quickly look through each [Periodic reviews](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Periodic+reviews) templates to see if there are any modifications you want to make (ex., prompts)
    - [Daily Template](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Daily+Template)
    - [Weekly Review Template](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Weekly+Review+Template)
    - [Monthly Review Template](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Monthly+Review+Template)
    - [Quarterly Review Template](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Quarterly+Review+Template)
    - [Yearly Review Template](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Yearly+Review+Template)
- [ ] Create a note for the current year and follow [My yearly review workflow > Plan](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+yearly+review+workflow#Plan):
    - Declare a yearly theme
    - Plan [Wheel of life](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Wheel+of+life) ratings and the associated [12-Month Celebration](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/12-Month+Celebration)
    - Create yearly goals in [My Goals](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Goals/My+Goals)
- [ ] Create a note for the current [Quarterly reviews](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Quarterly+reviews)
    - [ ] Create any quarterly goals and link them to this quarter
- [ ] Create a note for the current [Monthly reviews](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Monthly+reviews)
    - [ ] Create any monthly goals and link it to this month
- [ ] Create a note for the current week
    - [ ] Create any weekly projects in [My Projects](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Projects/My+Projects) and link them to this week

### Personal Knowledge Management 

#### Sources 

Set up your capturing method:

- [ ] Check out [Fleeting Notes App](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/fleeting-notes-app) and [Readwise Reader](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/readwise-reader)
- [ ] What information are you keen to capture in your Obsidian vault?
- [ ] Do either of these apps resonate with your information capture needs?
- [ ] If so, watch the accompanying video for the app to learn my workflow and start setting it up based on the instructions
- [ ] With the app you chose, do a test run! Collect highlights and insights and make sure it properly gets synced to your Obsidian vault

Organize your inputs:

- [ ] Add any courses or series you are learning from in [My Input Collections](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Inputs/My+Input+Collections/My+Input+Collections)

#### Organize 

- [ ] Create [My Maps of Content (MOCs)](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Resources/My+MOCs/My+Maps+of+Content+\(MOCs\)) for the main topics you are interested in
- [ ] Create any additional note types you need by following the process in [Create a new note type](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Create+a+new+note+type)

#### Approach 

- [ ] To find balance in the consumption vs creation process and maintain your vault, make time every day for reviewing [My Input Processing Station](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Input+Processing+Station)
- [ ] When you start to have more notes, follow the appropriate `Approach` outlined in [USV Module - Learn vault systems and workflows](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/USV%20Module%20-%20Learn%20vault%20systems%20and%20workflows)

#### Result 

- [ ] Create new [Note types](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Note%20types) for [My Outputs](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Outputs/My+Outputs) beyond just brainstorms to help you streamline your creation process. Examples include:
    - Writings
    - Youtube videos
    - Newsletters
    - Tweets
    - You can see examples of these in [My Digital Galaxy](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Areas/My+Digital+Galaxy)

### Productivity 

If already done [Life Design](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Module%20-%20Set%20up%20the%20vault#Life%20Design) setup:

- [ ] Elaborate on and plan your goals using [My goal setting workflow](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+goal+setting+workflow) for:
    - Yearly goals
    - Quarterly goals
    - Monthly goals
- [ ] Elaborate on and plan your weekly projects and outputs using [My project workflow](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+project+workflow)
- [ ] Go through your imported notes or top-of-mind thoughts and add/link them to the related project/goal
- [ ] [Set up your task management](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Set+up+your+task+management) system to help manage the tasks from your projects
- [ ] For each habit or measurement you want to track, follow [My habits workflow](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My%20habits%20workflow)

#### Maintenance 

Use the timeframes in [Life Design](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Module%20-%20Set%20up%20the%20vault#Life%20Design) to make time for managing and updating the related actions:

- Daily -> Tasks
- Weekly -> Projects
- Monthly / Quarterly / Yearly -> Goals
- Yearly -> Theme / Values
