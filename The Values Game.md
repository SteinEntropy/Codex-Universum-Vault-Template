> [!info] [[My Values]]

## Principles
- This was a workbook recommended by my therapist to understand the three kinds of values you have:
	- Identity values
	- Character values
	- Activity values

### Process
- You look at a list of words and slowly narrow down your selections into a select few
- Used to help know your values during important decisions you are trying to make
- If you're interested, you can also try it for yourself [here](https://www.dphillips.com/the-values-game)
